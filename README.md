# Task: Backend2
## Description:

There is a virtual machine with limited resources (512MB of RAM and the same amount of free disk space)
There is also an AWS S3-like service (Yandex, PS.kz , Self-hosted Mini)

It is necessary to organize the fastest (in several streams) downloading of large files, more than 1.5 GB.

It is necessary to write a small web application consisting of two parts:
On the endpoint's backend receiving data and uploading it immediately to S3.
On the front, selecting a file and sending it to the endpoint implemented on the backend.

Uploading via a presigned url is NOT counted as a solution to the problem.
The file must pass through backend applications.
